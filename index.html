    <h1 id="a-simple-guide-on-how-to-use-the-discord-py-library">A simple guide on how to use the <code>discord.py</code> library</h1>
    <p>This tutorial is aimed to teach people how to use the <code>discord.py</code> library, <br>
      and how to create a discord bot with the library itself.
    </p>
    <h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Python 3.9.4 (or any 3+, won't make much difference)</li>
      <li>discord.py 1.7.2</li>
      <li>A bot account and token</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Don't know how to install discord.py? See <a href="https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/">here</a></p>

        <p>The goal of this tutorial is to <em>teach</em> you something. <br> 
          This means that you should write the code yourself <br> and understand what you are writing. 
          This way, you'll be able to make your own commands after this tutorial. <br>
          I will explain each part what I'm doing there in great detail, and clarify why I do so. <br>
          This tutorial is not intended to let you blindly copy paste the code, but that you learn how to use the library. <br>
          Please contact me on discord if you don't understand any part. I'll be more than happy to help.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>Knowledge of Python language is extremely handy. <br> You can chose to start with the <code>discord.py</code> library, but it will be difficult.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In general, YouTube tutorials are bad. Please do not follow them as they are just for you to copy code. I will explain it in detail <a href="">here</a></p>
