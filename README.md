# A simple guide on how to use the `discord.py` library

This tutorial is aimed to teach people how to use the `discord.py` library, <br>
and how to create a discord bot with the library itself.



### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9.4 (or any 3+, won't make much difference)
- discord.py 1.7.2

Don't know how to install discord.py? See [here](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)


### Some notes before we dive into the tutorial

- The goal of this tutorial is to _teach_ you something. <br> 
  This means that you should write the code yourself <br> and understand what you are writing. 
  This way, you'll be able to make your own commands after this tutorial. <br>
  I will explain each part what I'm doing there in great detail, and clarify why I do so. <br>
  This tutorial is not intended to let you blindly copy paste the code, but that you learn how to use the library. <br>
  Please contact me on discord if you don't understand any part. I'll be more than happy to help.

- Knowledge of Python language is extremely handy. <br> You can chose to start with the `discord.py` library, but it will be difficult.

- In general, YouTube tutorials are bad. Please do not follow them as they are just for you to copy code. I will explain it in detail [here]()
