# Chapter 2 | Overview of Discord
In this chapter, we are learning what the discord API does.

### About the Discord gateway
The gateway is how your bot receives events from Discord. It is a simple websocket connection to Discord. <br>
But, when you are using the `discord.py` library, you don't have to worry about that at all. The library does this for you. <br>
Therefore we won't get into this any further, if you are curious, [check this out](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway)
